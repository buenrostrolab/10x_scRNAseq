\title{Analysis functions}
\usage{
run_pca(gbm, n_pcs = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{gbm}{a GeneBCMatrix to run PCA on}

\item{n_pcs}{The number of principal components to compute}
}
\value{
A list containing \itemize{
\item "x" - The rotated data matrix where rows are barcodes and columns are PCs
\item "rotation" - The loadings (eigenvectors) where each column is a PC
\item "use_genes" - The list of gene indices that were used
\item "normalized_mat" - The matrix that was used as input to the PCA
}
}
\description{
Run principal components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of a gene-barcode matrix
}
\examples{
pca <- run_pca(gbm1, n_pcs=2)
plot(PC2 ~ PC1, pca$x)

}
